I’m a Front-End Developer with a passion for creating attractive user-friendly applications. I have a great deal of interest in all things JavaScript and UI/UX design despite the fact I am not a designer **yet**. This year I plan on writing more and hopefully getting over my fear of public speaking 😧.
